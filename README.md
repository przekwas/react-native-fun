# React Native Fun!

## Making my own little react native app as a learning sandbox
One of my primary goals was to get a better handle on mastering react native flexbox styling and making my own components without using a UI toolkit!

I made my own API to show the albums and their titles so I can map my own cards out in the app

### Running
I used the react-native-cli to generate the react native app, so running it will require you have that

Clone the repo, npm install, and react-native run-ios !
